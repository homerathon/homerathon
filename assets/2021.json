    "We would like to thank Sändra Washington from the Lincoln City Council, as well as all of our hymn-readers, who may be found by <a onclick='seek(10099);'>clicking here</a> to jump to the credits. You may also jump to other sections by scrolling through the menu below.",
    "We'd also like to thank Dr. Hart and Dr. Lippman for their guidance and commentary this year, and for last year's <br><a href='/2020archive'>Homerathon: A Panhellenic Plague Performance</a>",
    "Without further ado, we present the <i>Homeric Hymns</i>! We look forward to seeing you next year, in person, for another <i>Illiad</i> Homerathon on UNL's Campus!"
