    "We'd also like to thank Dr. Hart and Dr. Lippman for their guidance and commentary this year, and for last year's <br><a href='./2020archive'>Homerathon: A Panhellenic Plague Performance</a>",
    "Without further ado, we present the <i>Homeric Hymns</i>! We look forward to seeing you next year, in person, for another <i>Illiad</i> Homerathon on UNL's Campus!"
